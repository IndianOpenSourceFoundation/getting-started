## Dynamic cli Supercharged cli with Autocomplete

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Strong experience with Python
 - Experience working with [xonsh](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh) is a plus point.

**Description**<br>

Dynamic CLI is growing day by day having 1k+ downloads as of now. But still, there are lots of improvements, features, and releases which are pending. This package will involve lots of complex features which we are a target for this GSoC.
To understand how this package works, try contributing to it. 
See the [issues](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli/issues), [contributing guide](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and 
[code of conduct.](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) . We are expanding our CLI to autocomplete. <br>
**For example:**  When a user types a few parts of the word, our CLI will suggest to them the options which are available in the terminal itself. To show how things should look, Please go through this [issue.](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli/issues/126)


**Suggested Issues to work on:**<br>
 - Autocomplete in the terminal : [#126 Autocomplete for Dynamic-CLI](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli/issues/126)
 - Adding Xonsh in our CLI : [#125 Adding Xonsh](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli/issues/125)

## Dynamic cli Improve our cli

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Experience with Python
 - Strong experience with maintaining Python Packages

**Description**<br>

As of now, Our CLI doesn't support windows. We have to make sure, it'll available for all the Operating Systems. So we are migrating one of our package i.e termios to a different package that support the same feature. Please go through with our ongoing [issue.](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli/issues/94) and the discussion [here](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli/discussions/97). We currently support GET, POST, DELETE in our Dynamic-CLI to test our APIs locally.

- See the available bugs and issues [here](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli/issues)
- See our [contributing guide](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- See our [code of conduct.](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

<strong>Project Task Checklist</strong>

- Expand our CLI to test the API without leaving the terminal.
- Expand our CLI to test the concurreny test on the APIs end point. Please find the opened issue [here](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli/issues/124)
- Add keybinding in our CLI to improve the user experience. So that they can access any feature with the help of keybinding.
- Add cross platform support in our CLI. Currently we only support MAC, LINUX based operating system.

**Suggested Issues to work on:**<br>
 - Keybinding in the CLI : [#117 Adding Keybindng to the Dynamic-CLI](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli/issues/117)
 - Cross Platform Support : [#120 Fix issues for windows](https://github.com/IndianOpenSourceFoundation/dynamic-cli/issues/120)

Suggesting or adding features, fixing bugs, or improving our exiting package
will help you to gain experience

## Dynamic cli Introspectable tunnels to localhost

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Strong experience with Protocols like TLS, TCP etc
 - Strong experience with maintaining Python Packages

**Description**<br>

This is one of the demanding features of our CLI. Every developer who tests their APIs/Frontend and shows how things work locally to their peers is quite difficult in this pandemic without setting up APIs locally but we are here to solve every problem related to the terminal. So, here we are with some of the features which we want to include:
- Expose any HTTP service behing the NAT or firewall to the internet.
- Expose any TCP service behind the NAT or firewall to the internet.
- Inspect all the requests/response that are transmitted over the tunnel.


<strong>Project Task Checklist</strong>

- Expose a secure web server on a custom port of your local machine to the internet.
- Inspection of traffic in your exposed web server and download the report in a PDF.
- Relaying the requests -> Developing for webhooks slow down your request. This relaying the request allow user to speed up the process by bypass those hooks or triggering those hooks in a different way.
- Adding a password while you are sharing your web server to the internet.

This is gonna be our powerful real-time inspection interface which allows you to see what traffic is sent to your application server and what responses you are returning. Dynamic-CLI allows users to inspect their shared web server on the internet. We'll track IPs, headers, requests, responses on the shared URL. 


<strong>Project Task Checklist</strong>

- Inspection on a secure web server on a custom port which is shared by our CLI to the internet.
- Inspection of traffic in your exposed web server. 
<br>**For example**: Who access those shared servers including their time, IPs, Request payload and response body
- Inspection should be visible in the UI which we are hosting in our local machine through our Dynamic-CLI.
- Filtering request through our interface.
- Donwload the reports of the server in a PDF form.

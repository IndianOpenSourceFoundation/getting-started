## Dynamic CLI

**Prerequisites**<br>
 - Experience with Python
 - Strong experience with maintaining Python Packages
 - Experience with maintaining activities on ASLO and ASLO-v4

**Description**<br>
Sugar has a lot of activities, with 250+ on GitHub, and more
elsewhere. These have scope for improvement; bugs,
features, updated human translations, and release.  This project will involve
working on **at least 12** activities to improve them. Students can choose
activities on their own, and are encouraged to select activities which
are either a part of Fructose or have a strong pedagogical value. To
understand how to locate and work on activities, see our guide to
[Modifying
Activities](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/contributing.md#modifying-activities)

In their proposal, students may mention _some_ of the issues they will
work on.  Any new feature suggestion should be discussed on GitHub
Issues or on the mailing list before being added to a proposal.

Since there are a lot of activities to work on, **more than one instance
of this project may be selected**.

**Suggested Issues to work on:**<br>
 - jukebox-activity: [#22 Add collaboration for sharing playlist items](https://github.com/sugarlabs/jukebox-activity/issues/22)

Other issues will have been raised since.

Suggesting or adding features, fixing bugs, or releasing activities
will help you to gain experience
